// The DIALOG CONTRACT — the one table that says, per interactive block kind, how to get its model
// out of a Block and how to compare two derivations of it. It is what makes the race guard generic:
// lib/dialog-guard.ts re-derives through `adapterFor(agent).buildBlocks` and then asks this table
// whether the fresh screen is still the one the user tapped, so an adapter that emits a block kind
// gets the guard for free — no harness ever appears in the guard's imports.
//
// The comparators themselves live next to their model types (harness/*-model.ts), because they ARE
// part of those contracts: the exact semantics of "same dialog" differ per kind and were each
// established empirically (a menu ARROW ignores the leftRight label it is about to change; the
// multi-select Submit walk ignores the pointer it is about to move but NOT a checkbox that flipped
// underfoot; the preview note flow ignores the note it is about to edit). This module only wires
// kind → {commits, identity, signature, region}; it invents no semantics of its own.
//
// Two signature accessors, because two different things are being protected:
//   * `signature` — the FRESHNESS token the client comparators lean on, normalised where the
//     choreography legitimately changes the screen (preview: coreSignature; multi-select: the
//     pointer/checkbox-normalised signature). The conformance suite pins it non-empty and
//     text-sensitive: an adapter returning "" or a constant silently disables the guard.
//   * `region` — the LITERAL text of the region, handed to the bridge as the expected-prompt binding
//     for the first write (HERDR prompt-binding). It must be text that is really on screen, so the
//     normalised signature can't stand in for it.
//
// Types + pure functions. It imports the neutral models and the Block AST only — never the registry,
// never a harness — so a model module can never end up depending on an adapter.
